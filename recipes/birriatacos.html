    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Dried chile peppers:</strong> The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Beef:</strong> Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seasonings:</strong>  You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
            <li>
                <strong>Olive oil:</strong> Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vinegar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the braising liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tortillas:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onion and cilantro:</strong> Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro for a final punch of flavor and texture.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Step-By-Step Instructions</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes, vinegar, and seasonings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest, then shred.
            </li>
            <li>
                Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro.
            </li>
        </ol>
